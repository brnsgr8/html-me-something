   <h1>Italy January 2020: The before times</h1>
   <p> Not long ago I decided to take a trip for a week to Italy. I arrived on January 2nd - right before Covid changed our lives forever. </p>  
   <p> Here are a few of my favorite attractions in each of the four cities I visited </p>

      The <a href="https://www.duomomilano.it/en/"> Duono di Milano</a> was beautiful. I even got to walk on the esquisitely carved rooftop!

   <h2> Venezia/ Venice </h2>
   <p>When I arrived in Venice, I didn't realize that only canals meant no cars.
      I got in much more walking than I expected but it was worth in to be able in a city where there wan't bumpet to bumper traffic to worry about.

   <p> There were boats everywhere with folks able to parallell park on water better than I can on land.  </p>

    <h2> Firenze/ Florence </h2>
        <p>In Florence, I was able to learn about traditional Northen Itallian cooking. Our meal started with a bruschetta and ended with us making a tiramisu.
           For the main course we made our own pasta. I think mine looked pretty good for a first attempt.

           You can also see the beautiful surroundings of the Tuscan countryside where the kitcheb was located.
